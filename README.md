#### Health Insurance Cross Sell

Casado Insurance is a B2C company whose core business is offering health insurance to individuals. Now it plans to implement a cross sell strategy focused on distribuiting car insurance to its customer base. Given that the budget for the sales is limited, it is necessary to prioritize those customers who are more likely to purchase the product. Then, a Data Scientist was consulted to build a machine learning model to order the customer base by propensity score.
